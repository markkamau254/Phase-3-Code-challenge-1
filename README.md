# *Phase 3 Code Challenge: Python Fundamentals*

## **Description** :
This assessment is designed to evaluate Python fundamental concepts.
This assessment adheres to Python syntax and best practices.
This assessment entails of nine python tasks.

###**Topics Covered:**
1. Basic data structures
2. Functions
3. Decorators
4. Sequences
5. Sets, Dictionaries
6. Object-Oriented Programming


## Project Breakdown
   **Tasks** ⚙️
- [x] **Function: add_numbers** : The Python function named add_numbers that takes two parameters num1 and num2, and returns the sum of the two numbers.
- [x] **Function: is_even** : The Python function named is_even that takes a single parameter number and returns True if the number is even, and False otherwise.
- [x] **Function: reverse_string** : The Python function named reverse_string that takes a string text as input and returns the reversed version of that string.
- [x] **Function: count_vowels** : The Python function named count_vowels that takes a string text as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Ignore case sensitivity.
- [x] **Function: calculate_factorial** : The Python function named calculate_factorial that takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
- [x] **Function: apply_decorator** : The Python function named apply_decorator that takes a function func as input and applies a decorator named decorator_func. The decorator should simply print "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.
- [x] **Sequences: Sort List of Tuples** : Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and an age, the task includes a Python function named sort_by_age that sorts the list of tuples by age in ascending order.
- [x] **Sets and Dictionaries: Merge Dictionaries** : The Python function named merge_dicts that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any common keys, their values should be summed up.
- [x] **Object-Oriented Programming: Class Creation** : The Task Defines a Python class named Car with the following attributes: make, model, year. Implement a method named display_info that prints out the car's information.

    Python

## System Requirements

          1. Operating System
          Python runs on all major operating systems, including:
          
          Windows: Windows 7 or newer (Windows 10/11 is recommended).
          macOS: macOS 10.9 or later.
          Linux: Most modern distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS) support Python.
          2. Hardware Requirements
          Processor (CPU):
          
          A modern, multi-core processor is recommended for running more computationally intensive Python programs. For basic scripts, even older processors will suffice.
          Examples: Intel Core i3/i5/i7, AMD Ryzen, or newer.
          Memory (RAM):
          
          Minimum: 2 GB (sufficient for simple scripts and small-scale projects).
          Recommended: 4 GB to 8 GB (enough for running most Python projects, small web apps, and data analysis).
          Heavy Use: 16 GB or more for large data analysis, machine learning models, or working with very large datasets.
          Storage:
          
          Minimum: 200 MB for Python itself, but you’ll need more space for external libraries, packages, and project files.
          Recommended: At least 10 GB of free storage to comfortably install Python, manage virtual environments, and handle project files.
          For Data Science/ML: If working with large datasets or AI models, ensure sufficient storage, potentially using SSDs for faster data access.
          GPU (Optional): For machine learning, deep learning, and other GPU-accelerated tasks, a CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU is recommended. You will need CUDA and cuDNN installed alongside Python libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
          
          3. Python Version
          Ensure you install the latest stable version of Python (Python 3.10 or later is recommended).
          Check if your project requires a specific Python version, as some projects may be compatible with Python 2 (though it is deprecated).
          4. Python Package Manager
          Pip: Ensure you have pip, the Python package installer, to install necessary third-party libraries.
          Virtual Environments: Use venv or tools like Anaconda for creating isolated environments.
          5. Optional Software
          IDE or Text Editor: A good integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor is helpful for writing Python code.
          Examples: PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, Sublime Text, etc.
          6. Internet Connection (Optional)
          An internet connection is needed for downloading Python libraries, packages, and updates.

## Installation

To use this repo, follow these steps:

### Alternative One
